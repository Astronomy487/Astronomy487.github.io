    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p><a href="../" target="_blank">This</a> is a game of chess I've been working on to prctice JavaScript. It doesn't have full functionality yet: you can't yet promote, castle, or en passant. There is no check/checkmate detection for the current board state or for moves (trust me I tried really hard), so the objective is to actually capture the opponent's king. If you're looking for a fuller chess experience right now, go to <a href="https://www.chess.com/" target="_blank">chess.com</a> or something.</p>
    <p>Instead, my version of chess designed to be customizable and allow for alternative chess modes with alternative pieces or board arrangements.</p>
    <h2>How do I make a gamemode?</h2>
    <p>I intend to make a proper editor in the future, but for now you have to write a .js file that contains the gamemode's pieces, starting board, and list of teams (as of right now, only 2-team games really work). If you want a .js file to model yours after, use <a href="../rules-standard.js" target="_blank">rules-standard.js</a>.</p>
    <p>To then play a gamemode you wrote, enter its URL after a question mark, like <u>https://astronomy487.github.io/projects/chess?rules-standard.js</u>.</p>
    <p>Here are some extra gamemodes I've made to show how it works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://astronomy487.github.io/projects/chess?rules-tiny.js" target="_blank">tiny</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://astronomy487.github.io/projects/chess?rules-pawns.js" target="_blank">pawn swarm</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://astronomy487.github.io/projects/chess?rules-queens.js" target="_blank">queen swarm</a></li>
    </ul>
