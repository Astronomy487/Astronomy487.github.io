    <h1>How to write an adventure</h1>
    <p>Each time the user has to make a decision and is shown where they are right now is called a state. Each state is identified by a unique id (which is text that can contain spaces).</p>
    <p>Once you have planned out your story and know how you will use states, create a .js file on your computer and open it in any plain text editor.</p>
    <p>Begin writing a state like this:</p>
    <code>
      state["<span class="magenta">wake up</span>"] = {<br>
      };
    </code>
    <p>Magenta text represents state ids.</p>
    <p>Within the curly brackets is the information for each state. Each state has four traits: the title, the image or gif, the description paragraph, and the set of choices the user can make. The first three are the easiest to make, like so:</p>
    <code>
      state["<span class="magenta">wake up</span>"] = {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">title</span>: "<span class="cyan">You woke up.</span>",<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">desc</span>: "<span class="cyan">Good morning!</span>",<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">image</span>: "<span class="cyan">photo.png</span>"<br>
      };
    </code>
    <p>The yellow text represents the traits of the state, and the cyan text represents text.</p>
    <p>In the example above, when the user gets to this page, the title "You woke up." will be at the top, an image of photo.png will show, and a paragraph below will say "Good morning!".</p>
    <p>No matter how many traits you include, all except the last one will need a comma after it.</p>
    <p>The final trait, the options for the user, is more complicated. It starts off like the others, but instead of using text surrounded by quotes, you create a set of options with brackets.</p>
    <code>
      state["<span class="magenta">wake up</span>"] = {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">title</span>: "<span class="cyan">You woke up.</span>",<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">desc</span>: "<span class="cyan">Good morning!</span>",<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">image</span>: "<span class="cyan">photo.png</span>",<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">option</span>: [<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>
      };
    </code>
    <p>Within the square brackets, put each option in curly brackets with two traits: label and link.</p>
    <code>
      state["<span class="magenta">wake up</span>"] = {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">title</span>: "<span class="cyan">You woke up.</span>",<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">desc</span>: "<span class="cyan">Good morning!</span>",<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">image</span>: "<span class="cyan">photo.png</span>",<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="yellow">option</span>: [<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<span class="yellow">label</span>: "<span class="cyan">Go to store</span>", <span class="yellow">link</span>: "<span class="magenta">store</span>"},<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<span class="yellow">label</span>: "<span class="cyan">Go to school</span>", <span class="yellow">link</span>: "<span class="magenta">school</span>"}<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>
      };
    </code>
    <p>In the example above, the user has two options: "Go to store", which links them to state "store", or "Go to school", which links them to state "school". Like before, all but the last option need a comma after the curly bracket. In the end, this is how state "wake up" will look:</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523666597492293634/797516988099330088/unknown.png">
    <p>Each of the four traits (title, desc, image, option), and even the traits for the options (label, link) can go in any order. Each of them is also optional and can be excluded if you want.</p>
    <p>And finally, somewhere in the .js file (outside of any state[] = {};) you should declare which state is the starting state, like so:</p>
    <code>
      current = "<span class="magenta">wake up</span>";
    </code>
    <p>Once you have this .js file with as many states as you want, you can use a link to the .js on the home page to begin playing. Happy adventuring!</p>
