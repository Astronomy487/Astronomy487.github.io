      <h2>What is Folte?</h2>
      <p>Folte is a minimalist logical language made by <a href="http://astronomy487.github.io/" target="_blank">me (Astro)</a> and inspired by Toki Pona, Toaq, Lojban and other languages like those three. This is just a fun project of mine that makes me think about communication in new ways.</p>
      <p>Folte’s primary mode of expression is what I call “math” notation, a set of symbols to describe the grammar behind a piece of text in the language, and it looks like this:</p>
      <div class="center b">N(AC<span class="ss">1<br>2</span>)<span class="ss">2<br>&nbsp;</span>(FH<span class="ss">2<br>1</span>)<span class="ss">3<br>&nbsp;</span>(D)<span class="ss">4<br>&nbsp;</span></div>
      <p>This is the mode Folte is primarily designed for, and other modes are just an abstraction of this math notation.</p>
      <p>This language is logical in that it uses boolean logic- and predicate logic-like principles to guide how the grammar works, how words are derived, and how ideas are conveyed. It is about arguments satisfying conditions to communicate meaning instead of following conventions from natural languages.</p>
      <p>It is alike Toki Pona in that it is minimalist and achieves full depth and meaning through as few structures as possible (really just four structures), but its sentences are usually more complex and hierarchical than Toki Pona (and there are certainly more words).</p>

    <article id="article-grammar">
      <h2>Clauses</h2>
      <p>A clause states that a relationship exists among a group of objects. Folte uses naming conventions of analogue structures in natural languages, so those objects will be called nouns, and the type of relationship among the nouns is defined by the verb. The verb comes first in the clause, and any number of nouns may come after. Let's look at an example definition of a verb:</p>
      <div class="center">Message: sender<sup>1</sup> sends message<sup>2</sup> containing content<sup>3</sup> to recipient<sup>4</sup></div>
      <p>Each of those nouns fill in the spots with superscript: sender, message, content, and recipient. These four slots are similar to cases, just that there are only four of them, they are numbered, and their use in a clause is defined by the verb. Not all cases need to be filled, and multiple nouns can have the same case in a clause.</p>
      <p>For use in math notation, a verb is just a string of letters or symbols whose first character is a capital letter.</p>
      <h2>Simple Nouns</h2>
      <p>Because all words in the dictionary are naturally verbs, nouns are created through verbs. Simple nouns can be created from one case of a verb. Sender, message, content, and recipient are all simple nouns you could make out of the verb "message". You'd say those nouns are from cases 1, 2, 3, or 4 of "message".</p>
      <p>Simple nouns also need to be marked with the case they take in the new clause.</p>
      <p>In math notation, simple nouns looks like this:</p>
      <div class="center b">Message<span class="ss">1<br>3</span>&emsp;Message<span class="ss">4<br>2</span></div>
      <p>The subscript indicates the case it is defined from, and the superscript defines its case in the new clause. The first segment above means "content" in case 1, and the second segment means "message" in case 4.</p>
      <h2>Clause Nouns</h2>
      <p>More intricate nouns are created by turning an entire clause into a noun, similar to nominal clauses or relative clauses. This structure also can give sentences more nuanced meanings.</p>
      <p>An entire clause is surrounded by parentheses and a superscript is placed outside to indicate its new case. "I want to see you" might look like this:</p>
      <div class="center b">Want Me<span class="ss">1<br>1</span> (See You<span class="ss">1<br>1</span>)<span class="ss">2<br>&nbsp;</span></div>
      <p>It is also possible to not nominalize the entire clause, but pick out a noun from within it. This is how adjectives and relative clauses are formed: you describe a noun that also happens to satisfy another verb. "I know the big dog" might look like this:</p>
      <div class="center b">Know Me<span class="ss">1<br>1</span> (Big Dog<span class="ss">1<br>1</span>)<span class="ss">2<br>1</span></div>
      <p>That subscript 1 indicates it is discussing noun 1 of the inner clause (the dog), and the superscript 2 indicates it goes into case 2 of "know".</p>
      <h2>Mappings and Structures</h2>
      <p>The grammar is defined in math notation, which is useful for conveying structures, but it doesn't sound very language-like to me. Any language-like forms of Folte will exist as some transformation from the math notation to a set of sounds and symbols.</p>
      <p>Any mapping requires a word form to be defined for every verb.</p>
      <p>There are a couple ways a full list of structures could be defined, but here's what I think makes the most sense for a mapping:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Verb</li>
        <li>Verb with sub- and superscript</li>
        <li>Verb opening a clause noun</li>
        <li>Clause noun closing with superscript</li>
      </ul>
