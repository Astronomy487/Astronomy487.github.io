<h1>Doc Template</h1>
<div class="sub">A document formatting template and a tutorial to its use created by <a href="https://astronomy487.github.io/" target="_blank">Astro</a> with JS from <a href="http://vrabbers.github.io/" target="_blank">Vrabbers</a>. You are free to use and modify this template for any need.</div>

<hr>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<div id="toc"></div>
<hr>

<h2 class="linkhead">Pre-Body Elements<h2>
<h3 class="linkhead">Head</h3>
<p>Inside of the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> of the document are four things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A link to <b>style.css</b></li>
<li>A link to a favicon</li>
<li>The title of the doument in <b>&lt;title&gt;</b></li>
<li>A <b>&lt;style&gt;</b> or link to a stylesheet containing:
  <ul>
  <li>A font applied to <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> (ideally with bold and italic fontfaces)</li>
  <li>A three-color palette which should look similar to this:</li>
  <code>:root {<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;--white: #f0f0f0;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;--color: #ff2e63;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;--black: #303841;<br>
  }</code>
  <li>Any other styling information you want to include yourself</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the font and colors are not supplied, the default values (as seen in this tutorial) will be used instead.</p>
<h3 class="linkhead">Page</h3>
<p>The entire page is encased in a <b>&lt;div class="main"&gt;</b> within the <b>&lt;body&gt;</b>. This main div provides the massive margins and some default padding and margins. If you want to add your own elements outside of the main document (likely absolute or fixed elements, possibly for things like navigation), feel free to do so — just be sure it is outside the main div.</p>
<p>The only element outside of the main div in the template is a link to the JS that generates the table of contents.</p>
<h3 class="linkhead">Title</h3>
<p>At the top of the page is the title of the document in an <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>. Underneath it is a subtitle or short paragraph contained in a <b>&lt;div class="sub"&gt;</b>, and it can be used for any information that you want to be seen immediately.
<h3 class="linkhead">Table of Contents</h3>
<p>The linked CSS and JS will automatically scan the document for headings and insert them into the table of contents. Including and excluding headings from the table of contents is explained later. This is the HTML for the table of contents:</p>
<code>&lt;hr&gt;<br>
&lt;h2&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
&lt;div id="toc"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;hr&gt;</code>
<p></p>
<p>If you use the prescribed template, all of the neccessary HTML will already be there for all the pre-body elements.</p>

<h2 class="linkhead">Body Elements</h2>
<h3 class="linkhead">Headings</h3>
<p>First order and second order headings are constructed with <b>&lt;h2&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;h3&gt;</b> tags, both of which require <b>class="linkhead"</b> in order to be automatically enumerated and entered into the table of contents. If you want to use an <b>&lt;h2&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;h3&gt;</b> without their enumeration, that will also work. Enumerated headings will break if any two have the same name.</p>
<h3 class="linkhead">Inline Elements</h3>
<p>Every paragraph should be encased by <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> tags so that the spacing between them is consistent. Paragraphs are technically a block element, but are included among the inline elements because of the inline elements within paragraphs.</p>
<p>In paragraphs, you can use <b>&lt;b&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;a&gt;</b>, both of which <b>look like this</b> (although <b>&lt;a&gt;</b>s are underlined when hovered, <a>like this</a>). In addition, <b>&lt;i&gt;</b> can be used for italics <i>like this</i>, but be aware that not all fonts have built-in italic fontfaces. <b>&lt;mark&gt;</b> produces text <mark>like this</mark>. For all inline markups, be mindful of the scenarios you use them in and what they indicate to the reader — inconsistent use ruins the point of a well-formatted document.
<p>Although I haven't written any custom CSS for these, <b>&lt;ul&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ol&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;dl&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;dt&gt;</b>, and <b>&lt;dd&gt;</b> should all work as you'd expect in any HTML.</p>
<h3 class="linkhead">Block Elements</h3>
<p><b>&lt;table class="data"&gt;</b> creates a table fit for most purposes, within which you should put <b>&lt;tr&gt;</b>s for each row and, in turn, <b>&lt;td&gt;</b>s and <b>&lt;th&gt;</b>s inside those. There is also formatting for a <b>&lt;caption&gt;</b> before the first <b>&lt;tr&gt;</b>, but it is optional.</p>
<table class="data"><caption>Populations of countries</caption>
<tr>  <th>Country</th>        <th>Population</th> </tr>
<tr>  <td>China</td>          <td>1,405 million</td> </tr>
<tr>  <td>India</td>          <td>1,370 million</td> </tr>
<tr>  <td>United States</td>  <td>330 million</td>  </tr>
<tr>  <td>Indonesia</td>      <td>269 million</td>  </tr>
<tr>  <td>Pakistan</td>       <td>220 million</td>  </tr>
</table>
<p>On the other hand, <b>&lt;table class="gloss"&gt;</b> is used for text in a gloss-like format used in translations.</p>
<table class="gloss">
<tr>  <td>I</td>  <td>like</td> <td>ice cream</td>  </tr>
<tr>  <td>J'</td> <td>aime</td> <td>la glace</td>   </tr>
</table>
<p><b>&lt;code&gt;</b> creates a chunk of code. Within this snippet, however, you still have to use HTML like <b>&amp;lt;</b> and <b>&amp;gt;</b> instead of <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b>, and <b>&lt;br&gt;</b> instead of a new line. They have no particular syntax highlighting. Code snippets looks like this:</p>
<code>&lt;h3 class="linkhead"&gt;Block Elements&lt;/h3&gt;</code>
<p><b>&lt;blockquote&gt;</b>s are also supported, in addition to a <b>&lt;cite&gt;</b> within them. How you format these quotations — quotation marks, em dashes, citation formats — is up to you, but of course, stay consistent.</p>

<h3 class="linkhead">Figures and Media</h3>
<figure class="r">
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Demirkazik_Crest_of_Aladag_Mountains_in_Nigde_Turkey.jpg" alt="the Taurus Mountains in Turkey">
  <figcaption>I don't know much about the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, but they sure are beautiful.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figures are the only element in the template that break the linear flow of the document. Instead of going after one block element and before another, they float to either the left or the right and allow text to wrap around it.</p>
<p>To include one, first identify where in the HTML it should be inserted. Text will begin to wrap immediately after — for this figure to the right, it is right after the Figures heading.</p>
<p>The class of the <b>&lt;figure&gt;</b> (either <b>class="l"</b> <b>class="r"</b>) indicate which side of the page it will float to. Within the <b>&lt;figure&gt;</b> is an <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> and a <b>&lt;figcaption&gt;</b>, the former containing a URL and alt and the latter containing a caption. Either can be omitted and the figure will still display properly. Remember that your caption should not be the same as your alt text!</p>
<p>Figures default to 300px in width, and their images max out at 200px in height. The height of the figure will extend as far as neccessary for the caption.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to include a block image or video between two other block elements, the <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;video&gt;</b> tags can be used. Their maximum dimensions are 500px by 400px. There is also bare-bones CSS for <b>&lt;audio&gt;</b>, although video and audio are not customized beyond appropriate margins and size. Overall, non-figure media is discouraged.</p>

<h2 class="linkhead">Using the Template</h2>
<h3 class="linkhead">Obtaining and Editing</h3>
Because I host the CSS and JS files, the only file you have to manage is the HTML. An blank HTML template ready to be edited can be found <a href="template.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Here is a full list of things you have to edit from this template yourself:
<ul>
<li>Change the <b>&lt;link rel="favicon" href=""&gt;</b> to include your favicon url under the <b>href</b></li>
<li>Change the <b>&lt;title&gt;</b> to your title</li>
<li>Include a font and three-color palette in your <b>&lt;style&gt;</b> or, alternatively, reference a CSS file that contains this information (if this is excluded, the default palette and font will be used instead)</li>
<li>Change the <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> to your title</li>
<li>Put a subtitle or short paragraph in <b>&lt;div class="sub"&gt;</b> (or delete it if you want)</li>
<li>Put all of the actual content (headings, inline elements, block elements, figures) in the spot marked with a comment in the template</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="linkhead">The Future of the Template</h3>
<p>There are certainly more elements I want to add to this. I also want to try to transition away from using classes of divs and use more semantic pieces of HTML.</p>
